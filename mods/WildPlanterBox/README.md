** Works with Feb 25th Update **

Adds a new wild planter box and wild farm tile that simulates wild conditions. Any plants planted in these boxes do not need fertilization nor irrigation and will contribute to the wild plant count for parks and nature reserves. Plants grow at normal wild speed.

They can be configured in the mod menu to require power / emit heat, if you so desire. The default is zero, which is no power or heat output.
