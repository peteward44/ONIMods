**Now compatible with "Big Merge" Update!**

Adds a new planter box that simulates wild conditions. Any plants planted in these boxes do not need fertilization and will contribute to the wild plant count for parks and nature reserves.

For balance, they require a [b]30w[/b] power supply and emit [b]250 DTU/s[/b] (about half of what a ceiling light emits)

[h2]Base game & DLC support[/h2]
This mod supports both [b]vanilla base game[/b], the [b]"Spaced Out" DLC[/b] and the [b]"Big Merge"[/b] update released in June 2021.
