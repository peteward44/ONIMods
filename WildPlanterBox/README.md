[h1]Wild Planter Box[/h1]

Adds a new planter box that simulates wild conditions. Any plants planted in these boxes do not need fertilization and will contribute to the wild plant count for parks and nature reserves.

For balance, they require a [b]30w[/b] power supply and emit [b]250 DTU/s[/b] (about half of what a ceiling light emits)

This is a [b]"Spaced Out" DLC ONLY[/b] mod - Base game support coming soon!

Please thumbs up & favorite this so others can find it more easily!
